- 👋 Hi, I’m @danieltomabba, I am a highly skilled data scientist, R&D specialist, epidemiologist, and public health informatics specialist with over 12 years of experience and a PhD in Epidemiology. 
- 👀 I’m interested in digital epidemiological surveillance systems and outbreak response management. I am able to bridge the gap between epidemiology and the science of technology merging both industries within the global health digital sphere.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and always keen on using public health informatics and data science research to tackle epidemiological and public health issues and provide information for key management decisions and actions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects involved in a unique combination of computer science, statistics, public health, and epidemiological background.
