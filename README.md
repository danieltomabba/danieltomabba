I am a highly skilled data scientist, R&D specialist, epidemiologist, and public health informatics specialist with over 12 years of experience and a PhD in Epidemiology. My expertise is in digital epidemiological surveillance systems and outbreak response management resulting in 16 peer reviewed publications so far with 742 citations including publications in high impact journals as The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal.

- I am able to bridge the gap between epidemiology and the science of technology merging both industries within the global health digital sphere. I have a unique combination of computer science, statistics, public health, and epidemiological background as evidenced by leading teams to develop solutions for Monkeypox and Lassa fever outbreak and Covid19 pandemic response in 9 countries summarized in 6 peer-reviewed publications and 1 book chapter

- I am proficient in the distribution, predictive analytical processes, and hypothetical modeling, which strengthens organizational operations successfully increasing data reporting from 30% to 95% within 24 hours using open data kit and form hub technology, as evidenced by 2 peer-reviewed publications. 

- I am always keen on using public health informatics and data science research to tackle epidemiological and public health issues and provide information for key management decisions and actions.
